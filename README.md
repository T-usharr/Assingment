# Assingment
The design of this application will be in this manner that 
we will be creating two stacks ,
In stack 1 the  essential operations 
like push and pop  will be performed as in stack2 also the same will be done.
But to implemnt Queue we will be popping out data from stack 1 then storing them in stack2 
there in reverse order and then from stack 2 we will pop() out the top which will be working as queue
and later  we will push all the elements from stack2 to stack1 as it was in initial stage.
